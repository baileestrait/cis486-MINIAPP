# Dev Lab QUEBEC

### As an individual developer
### I want to demonstrate a full stack data round trip
### So that I am qualified to work on a capstone dev team (and get an awesome job)

- From scratch, create a web-based MVC Single Page Application (SPA)
- Required technology stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, RestfulAPI 
- Source code and environments: local and remote with git & GitHub, proper security and access configurations, use of .gitignore
- Development features to include: nodemon, RESTful API, dotenv (for secrets/credentials)
- Functionality: demonstrate CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE), full stack round trip with persistent data
- Deployment: Render or another PaaS
- App standards: self-describing, authorship attributed, use of front-end frameworks (normalize.css, Bootstrap 5, jQuery/UI)
